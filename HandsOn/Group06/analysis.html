<p><strong>Data Analysis</strong></p>
<p>We have decided which of the resource's attributes we will keep for our project.</p>
<p>Our decision was to remove the dea code of the defibrilators as it is not relevant to our application, as well as the district code</p>
<p>We will also filter if the defibrilator's location is a public one by filtering the ownership column, which has a range of "Public" and "Private"</p>
<p><strong>Licensing</strong></p>
<p>The licensing of the data source is (CC BY 4.0), which means it is okay to use it commercialy and change the licensing as long as we give credit to the author. We do not plan to change the licensing as of yet.</p>
<p><strong>Naming strategy</strong></p>
<p>The naming strategy for the project will include an URI for each defibrilator</p>
<p><a >http://desfibriladores.com/resource/defibrilador/112</a></p>
<p>The attributes location_direction and the direction of the defibrilator will redirect the user to the web page of the location and the Google Maps URI of the coordinates respectively</p>

<p><strong>Structure of the ontology</strong></p>
<p>We have decided to create the following classes and properties to organize our ontology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes: Desfibrilador, Establecimiento, Titularidad, Municipio, Direccion, HorarioAcceso</li>
<li>Properties: hasEstablecimiento, hasTitularidad, hasCodigoMunicipio, hasNombreMunicipio, hasCodigoViaDireccion, hasNombreViaDireccion, hasNumeroPortalDireccion, hasPisoDireccion, hasPuertaDireccion, hasCodigoPostalDireccion, hasUbicacionDireccion, hasCoordXDireccion, hasCoordYDireccion, hasHorarioAcceso, hasMunicipio, hasDireccion.</li>
</ul>
